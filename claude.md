# Leap Motion Finger Individuation Space Invaders Game

## Project Overview
A rehabilitation/training game that uses Leap Motion hand tracking to practice finger individuation. Players must press specific fingers to shoot down incoming missiles.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- Missiles descend from the top of the screen toward target zones
- Each missile is assigned to a specific finger (left or right hand)
- Player must press the correct finger to shoot and destroy the missile
- Wrong finger press fires a missile that misses the target
- Visual hand model shows which fingers need to be pressed

### Calibration System
- First-time setup calibrates hand position and finger press detection
- Records baseline finger positions and press thresholds
- Saves calibration to `calibration_data.json` for future sessions
- Option to recalibrate or use existing calibration on startup

### Hand Tracking
- Real-time Leap Motion hand tracking
- Visual representation of both hands with fingertip highlighting
- Game pauses automatically when hands leave tracking area
- Finger press detection based on calibrated thresholds

### Difficulty & Scoring
- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives, lose one when missile reaches bottom
- **Score**: +10 points for correct hit, -5 for wrong finger
- **Difficulty**: Adjusts dynamically based on performance
  - Correct answers increase missile speed and spawn rate
  - Wrong answers decrease difficulty slightly
  - Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert

```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- pygame >= 2.5.0
- leap (Leap Motion SDK Python bindings)
- numpy

## Installation

1. Install Leap Motion SDK and ensure service is running
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Finger Press**: Shoot at corresponding missile lane
- **ESC**: Pause/Menu
- **SPACE**: Start game / Continue
- **R**: Recalibrate

## Finger Mapping
```
Left Hand:              Right Hand:
[Pinky][Ring][Mid][Idx][Thumb] | [Thumb][Idx][Mid][Ring][Pinky]
  L5    L4   L3   L2    L1    |   R1    R2   R3   R4    R5
```

## Calibration Process
1. Place hands in comfortable position above Leap Motion
2. Press each finger individually when prompted
3. System records "rest" and "pressed" positions
4. Threshold calculated as midpoint between states

## Technical Notes

### Finger Press Detection
- Uses finger tip Y-position relative to hand palm
- Press detected when tip drops below calibrated threshold
- Debounce timer prevents multiple triggers from single press

### Difficulty Scaling
- Base missile speed: 2 pixels/frame
- Speed multiplier increases 0.1 per correct answer (max 2.0)
- Spawn interval decreases with difficulty
- Wrong answers reduce multiplier by 0.05 (min 0.5)

## Development History
- v1.0.0 - Initial implementation with full feature set

## Known Issues
- Leap Motion SDK must be properly installed separately
- Game requires good lighting for optimal hand tracking

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multiple game modes (timed, endless, challenge)
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] High score persistence
- [ ] Multiplayer support
- [ ] Analytics and progress tracking
