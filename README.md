# Finger Invaders - Leap Motion Edition

A Space Invaders-style rehabilitation/training game using Leap Motion hand tracking for finger individuation practice.

## Overview

Missiles descend from the sky, each assigned to a specific finger. Press the correct finger to shoot them down! The game tracks both hands with 10 lanes (5 fingers per hand) and provides visual feedback through a hand model display.

## Features

- **10-finger tracking** - Full support for both left and right hands
- **Calibration system** - Personalized finger press detection thresholds
- **Adaptive difficulty** - Adjusts based on your performance
- **Visual hand model** - Real-time display of your hand positions
- **Finger highlighting** - Shows which fingers need to be pressed
- **Auto-pause** - Game pauses when hands leave the tracking area
